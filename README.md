## Project Instructions

NOTE : before everything, I request you to create your twilio account which will be used for initiating calls 

1. Now, the first step is to  open your twilio portal, get your number and generate 'account_sid' & 'auth_token'.

2. The second step is, to verify the number on which you want to calls

3. Third step is to open vsScraper.py in a editor & replace all the above values in the code (for the respective position of values, you can refer to the comments)

4. Now, comes the final step i.e to run the file, you can do that directly by double tapping on file or open you command line, go to your file location and type the following command
```bash
  python3 vsScraper.py
```
